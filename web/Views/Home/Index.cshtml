    <h3><b>Parents</b></h3>

    <li><b>Classes</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>This week will be the last class before school opens.</li>
        <li>We will have 2 weeks break before everybody settles in to the school and regular routine.</li>
        <li>I will send schedule to choose during this peroid time</li>
        <li>Ideally I want every student to come back to finish the rest of basic Java session which may take another 8 sessions. As the studens become busy with their regular study work and other activities , I understand that it may not be possible for some students to come back. </li>
        <li>This reminder session will be open to only those students <b>who finishes the notes and homework 100%</b> (attendance was ignored.). If any student has problem in any home work, I am happy to sit with him/her one on one and clarify any questions they have.
    </ul>

    <li><b>Payment</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>I started attendance but not every student had submitted the attendance on regular basis. If you can remember number of classes for your kid then you can pay :x*7 amount. Payment can be done, cash, check (Sairama Jamalapuram) or paypal (sairamaj@hotmail.com) (use Java as notes in paypal)</li>
        

        <li>
            Once I get payment from everyone, I will publish the details here about the total amount which we are going to send it to Sankara Eye foundation.
        </li>
        </ul>
    <ul>

</ul>

<h3><b>Students</b></h3>
    <li> Finish your notes and homework. If you have any questions , doubts you can stop by for one on one session. Send me email and we can setup suitable time. </li>
    <li> We can take this journey to Adavanced Java and then to Android Mobile development. For this journey doing homework is very important </li>

    <h3><b>Parents</b></h3>

     <li><b>Payment</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Payment for each class is reduced from <b>$10</b> to <b>$7</b> (with the same goal of 100% goes to charity)</li>
        <li>Payment was originally for $10 per each class. When originally price was decided, I was assuming that, not many people will be attending and also can finish the basic java course in Summer. My both assumptions were wrong. With lot of students enrolled and interested and also afer finishging 5 sessions,it was unreasonable to finish the basic java course in just 10 sessions or so. Also I was going slow purposefully to make students comfortable with basics (and not to scare them away from programming with too much technical stuff in short time). My intention is to make every student comfortable with basic Java and whoever interested can purse in advanced concepts later. With this I am afraid, I cannot finish in summer and want to extend this in to school sessions(and timings will change). I know once school year starts kids have different kind of activities and may not have much time. I will try to get the basic Java may be in couple of months with weekends classes. If they can come and finish till they get basic concepts that will be great. Thanks for understanding.</li> 
        <li>I will get the payment amount for each of you by end of August and the details how to pay.</li>
